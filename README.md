# win-with-c

This repository is a comprehensive guide to exploring Windows development using the C programming language. It focuses on leveraging the Windows API , standard DLLs , and header files  to interact with the Windows operating system at a low level. The content is designed to cater to both beginners and advanced developers, covering 32-bit  and 64-bit  systems.

### About This Repository

The goal of this project is to provide a hands-on learning experience for developers who want to understand how to builds Windows applications, libraries and utilities using C. By diving into the Windows API, you'll learn how to create executable (`.exe`) and dynamic link libraries (`.dll`), interact with system resources, and develop robust applications for the Windows platform.

### Key Features 
- Windows API Exploration : Learn how to use the Windows API to interact with the operating system.
- Standard DLL Interaction : Utilize standard Windows DLLs (e.g., `kernel32.dll`, `user32.dll`, `gdi32.dll`) for system-level programming.
- 32-bit and 64-bit Support : Code examples and explanations are provided for both architectures.
- Practical Examples : Real-world projects like text editors, system tray utilities, and file explorers.
- GitHub Integration : All code is hosted on GitHub, with clear instructions for setup and usage.

- Differences between 32-bit and 64-bit development

### **2. Core Windows API Concepts**
- Working with windows, controls, and dialog boxes
- File I/O using Windows API (`CreateFile`, `ReadFile`, `WriteFile`)
- Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs): Creating and using them
- Multithreading and synchronization

### **3. Advanced Topics**

- Networking with Winsock (TCP/IP client-server applications)
- Windows Services: Creating and managing background services
- Inter-Process Communication (IPC) techniques

### **4. System-Level Programming**
- Registry manipulation
- Memory management and debugging
- Shell integration and custom context menus
- Security and access control
